TODO Computer Vision

-Continuing & Finishin Local Model that's efficent enough to run on Raspi

-Changing file path for training from local to aiaa desktop?
-Possibly different training data apart from what's being used (cocodataset)

-Cleaning up detection stream, fixing any minor bugs (using mostly for testing, not for final prod)

-Getting flight controller information to the Raspi



BASIC INFO
'.gitignore'
-Very important for not pushing any big files onto github that won't fit

'build_suas_dataset.py'
-Counting/tracking class frequencies(objects


'data.yaml"
-Text file that contains the path to training images, and information on what specifically needs to be detected


'detect_stream.py'
-Flask webpage that allows you to see the camera output, and what the computer detects
-Webpage allowing any device to connect via the ip address the program gives in it's console
